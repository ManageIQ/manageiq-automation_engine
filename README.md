Automation Engine plugin for ManageIQ.

## Engine Description

There are two types of storage for the Automation Engine:

The Automation Datastore is the persistent storage and it can be viewed/edited by the EVM Automate Object Explorer.  The data lives in SQL Tables beginning with miq_ae: miq_ae_namespaces, miq_ae_classes, miq_ae_fields, miq_ae_values, miq_ae_instances, miq_ae_methods.
The Automation Workspace is the transient storage of the in-memory object hierarchy.  There is a SQL Table called miq_ae_workspaces, but it is not currently leveraged and can be ignored for now.

Each Automation Engine invocation runs in an isolated Workspace.

Automate Engine is invoked with a URI and leverages URIs throughout.  So, a solid understandings of URIs is a must.  A URI stands for Uniform Resource Identifier and can be read about here http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniform_Resource_Identifier and http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3986.

Here is a grammar for a URI:

     URI         = scheme ":" hier-part [ "?" query ] [ "#" fragment ]

     hier-part   = "//" authority path-abempty
                 / path-absolute
                 / path-rootless
                 / path-empty


Here is a typical example:

    foo://example.com:8042/over/there?name=ferret#mouth
    \_/   \______________/\_________/ \_________/ \___/
     |           |             |           |        |
    scheme   authority        path       query   fragment


The Automation Engine supports two schemes (currently):

| Scheme    | Description                                 |
| --------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| `miqaedb` | get an object from the Automation Datastore |
| `miqaews` | get an object from the Automation Workspace |

### Dynamic Instantiation Process (`AE_DIP`)

* Add `display_name` for namespace and value (for STEP field and completeness)
* Add condition for field and value (IF/UNLESS)
* Add collect for value (overrides definition in FIELD)
* Define new type of field called STEP
* `AE_DIP` should process steps as follows:
  1. Should convert steps to relationships appending `#${#ae_message}`
  2. Dynamically call methods `before_step` and `after_step` (or `on_state_change`)
  3. Should roughly internalize working of `provision_state_machine` to allow for others to be defined easier

## Development

See the section on plugins in the [ManageIQ Developer Setup](http://manageiq.org/docs/guides/developer_setup/plugins)

For quick local setup run `bin/setup`, which will clone the core ManageIQ repository under the *spec* directory and setup necessary config files. If you have already cloned it, you can run `bin/update` to bring the core ManageIQ code up to date.
